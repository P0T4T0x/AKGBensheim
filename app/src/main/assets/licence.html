                indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by<br />
                contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br />
                outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>

                permissions granted by this License.</p>

            <p>&quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including<br />
                but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration<br />
                files.</p>

            <p>&quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made<br />
                available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included<br />

            <p>&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that<br />
                is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,<br />
                annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an<br />
                original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works<br />
                shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by<br />
                name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>

            <p>&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version<br />
                of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works<br />

                by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit<br />
                on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,<br />

                to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br />
                communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and<br />
                issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for<br />
                the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication<br />
                that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright<br />

            <p>&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf<br />

            <p>2. Grant of Copyright License.</p>

            <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby<br />
                grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,<br />
                irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br />
                publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such<br />
                Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>

            <p>3. Grant of Patent License.</p>

            <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby<br />
                grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,<br />
                irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have<br />
                made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where<br />
                such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor<br />
                that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination<br />
                of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was<br />
                submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
                cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a<br />
                Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory<br />
                patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License<br />
                for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

            <p>4. Redistribution.</p>

            <p>You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof<br />
                in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,<br />
                provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>

            <p>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of<br />
                this License; and<br />
                You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You<br />
                changed the files; and<br />
                You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,<br />
                all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form<br />
                of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the<br />
                Derivative Works; and<br />
                If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any<br />
                Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the<br />
                attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices<br />
                that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the<br />
                following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the<br />
                Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along<br />
                with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative<br />
                Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of<br />
                the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the<br />
                License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that<br />
                You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,<br />
                provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as<br />
                modifying the License.<br />
                You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide<br />
                additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or<br />
                distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,<br />
                provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies<br />
                with the conditions stated in this License.</p>

            <p>5. Submission of Contributions.</p>

            <p>Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted<br />
                for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and<br />
                conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br />
                Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of<br />
                any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding<br />
                such Contributions.</p>

            <p>6. Trademarks.</p>

            <p>This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,<br />
                service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for<br />
                reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and<br />
                reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

            <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p>

            <p>Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the<br />
                Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,<br />
                WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,<br />
                including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,<br />
                NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are<br />
                solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or<br />
                redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of<br />
                permissions under this License.</p>

            <p>8. Limitation of Liability.</p>

            <p>In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),<br />
                contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate<br />
                and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br />
                liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,<br />
                or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or<br />
                out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to<br />
                damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or<br />
                any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has<br />
                been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

            <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.</p>

            <p>While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to<br />
                offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or<br />
                other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,<br />
                in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your<br />
                sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You<br />
                agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br />
                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your<br />
                accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

            <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
